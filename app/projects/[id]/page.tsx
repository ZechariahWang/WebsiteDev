    image: '/Eclipse.jpg',
    longDescription: `Eclipse Robotics is a collection of tools that I have developed to help high school students in the VEX Robotics Competition. Eclipse consists of a fully autonomous robotics library, AI virtual robot envrionment simulator, and a fullstack web application for scouting other teams during the competition. Altogether, Eclipse Robotics has earned 37+ awards throughout its three years of development, and has ranked 1st in Alberta, 6th in Canada, and top 0.26% globally in the VRC competition.`,

    longDescription: `Mecha Mayhem is Canada's largest robotics tournament, with over 3000 attendees and 200+ teams from middle school, high school, and university. I was on 2024 software team, where I developed a fullstack website in Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the competition. I also developed an award and team data analytics tool using the RobotEvents API, which displays the awards and stats of each team that competed.`,

    technologies: ['Next.js', 'Firebase', 'Vapi', 'Gemini'],
    image: '/InterviewTrainer.png',
    longDescription: `I developed a real-time AI interview platform leverages Vapi Voice Agents to simulate natural conversational interviews. It features a 108-term keyword normalization system that standardizes tech stack inputs, allowing for consistent and accurate voice-driven interactions. The platform includes live voice processing and transcription capabilities to enhance real-time responsiveness. Additionally, it integrates Firebase authentication within a Next.js framework to provide secure user sign-in and access to personalized features such as profiles, recent interviews, and detailed interview history.`,

    image: '/MentalSupport.png',
    longDescription: `AI intelligent chatbot designed to support mental health conversations by understanding and responding to user input with empathy and relevance. Built using PyTorch, it features a 3-layer fully connected neural network trained to classify user intent with high accuracy. Through iterative fine-tuning and optimization, the model achieved a 15% improvement in intent classification. The system utilizes NLTK for natural language preprocessing, including tokenization and lemmatization, and is deployed within a CustomTKinter interface to provide an accessible and responsive user experience tailored for mental wellness support.`,

    image: '/WATonomous.png',
    longDescription: `This project simulates autonomous vehicle navigation using a ROS2 publisher-subscriber architecture built on the DDS protocol. It features real-time obstacle avoidance logic by generating a dynamic cost-map from LiDAR and odometry data. The system combines the Pure Pursuit algorithm with A* path planning to enable efficient and adaptive robot movement, allowing the vehicle to detect and navigate around obstacles in real time.`,

    description: 'Robot entertainment switch that does nothing.',
    technologies: ['RobotC', 'Path Planning', 'Localization'],
    image: '/AE.jpg',
    longDescription: `This project is a simple switch game, but with a twist: it builds a dynamic map of boundaries and obstacles to make it harder for the user to flip the switch. The robot simulates intelligent robot behavior using a boundary-aware navigation system written in C for the EV3 platform. The robot uses a custom PID-controlled movement and rotation system to traverse predefined regions while adjusting its behavior based on human proximity and difficulty level. By integrating geometric boundary detection algorithms and real-time motion planning, the robot can respond to switch interactions, avoid obstacles, and adapt its path using randomized maneuvers.`,
